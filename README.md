# PunchClock
_A basic Windows Forms Punch Clock application that allows staff to Punch In/Out of work._

* Staff select their name from a dropdown list and enter their unique 3-6 digit pin code in order to punch in/out of their shift.

* Action to Punch In/Out is determined by the last action a staff member performed. If they last "punched in", their next action in the system would be to "punch out"

* Data is saved into a Microsoft Access Database. Reporting can be generated to allow for easy calculation of the pay owed an employee.
