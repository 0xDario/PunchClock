# PunchClock
_A basic Windows Forms Punch Clock application that allows staff to Punch In/Out of work._

* Staff select their name from a dropdown list and enter their unique 3-6 digit pin code in order to punch in/out of their shift.

* Action to Punch In/Out is automatically determined by the last action a staff member performed. If they last **'punched in'**, their next action in the system would be to **'punch out'**

* Data is saved to a Microsoft Access Database **[PunchClock.accdb]**. Reporting can be generated to allow for easy calculation of the pay owed an employee.

* Credentials for Microsoft Access Database:
    |username|password|
    |----|-------|
    |Admin|admin123|
